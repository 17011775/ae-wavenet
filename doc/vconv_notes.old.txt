What is shadow doing?

It first calculates the induced field range, then
calculates the position offsets.  It's probably best to redo this.

Steps needed to calculate induced field:

For a given input range, the induced field range is also expressed as a range on the input.  
It is the set of elements in the input that are "covered" by the output.  Covered means
that the key element of the filter is above them.

It is also known as the shadow.  

The IFR of a single element i, which is "far" from the edges, is [i-rw, i+lw].
The IFR of the entire range [o, l) is [lw, l-1-rw].  (Note the closed interval style)

The IFR of a general single element, which may be close to the edges, is:
[max(lw, i-rw), min(l-1-rw, i+lw)]

If this range is empty (or inverted), there is no output.

So, now that we have the IFR, we need to translate it into the output
element.  The output is related to the input in an affine way.  It is
first offset by lw, then spaced by osp.  For the begin element,
we want to choose the 


1. translate the input index in_b to the spaced index si_b
2. calculate the induced field range of the entire spaced input, if_min, if_max
3. calculate the induced field range of the begin element, [bf_min, bf_max]
4. take the minimum position in the intersection, which is:
   max(if_min, bf_min), min(if_max, bf_max)
   bf_min_adj
   if it is empty, return the empty set
5.  


Steps for rfield:

1. calculate the maximal shadow in index coordinates:
   [if_min, if_max] = [lw, (in_l-1) * isp - rw]

2. for out_b, calculate its shadow, assuming no limits:
   [b_si_min0, b_si_max0] = [out_b * osp, out_b * osp + rw + lw]

3. calculate the restricted range of out_b's shadow:
   [b_si_min, b_si_max] = [max(if_min, b_si_min0), min(if_max, b_si_max0)]

4. for out_e - 1, calculate its shadow, assuming no limits:
   [e_si_min0, e_si_max0] = [(out_e - 1) * osp, (out_e - 1) * osp + rw + lw]

5. calculate the restricted range
